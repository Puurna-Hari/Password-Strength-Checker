# Password-Strength-Checker
A Django-based web application that analyzes and classifies password strength using Machine Learning models.
# 🔐 Password Strength Checker

A **Machine Learning + Django** web application that predicts the **strength of a password** (Weak, Medium, or Strong) based on various security and linguistic features.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project helps users evaluate how secure their passwords are by leveraging a **trained ML model** that analyzes the structure, length, and complexity of the password.  
It’s a complete end-to-end solution — from **data preprocessing** and **model training** to **web deployment**.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap  
- **Backend:** Django Framework (Python)  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy  
- **Deployment (optional):** Render / Hugging Face Spaces / AWS

## 🧩 Key Features
✅ Real-time password strength prediction  
✅ Interactive and user-friendly web interface  
✅ Machine Learning model trained on real-world password dataset  
✅ Modular and scalable code structure  
✅ Easy retraining and deployment support

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User enters a password in the input field.  
2. The password is converted into numerical and structural features.  
3. The trained ML model predicts the password strength category.  
4. The result (Weak / Medium / Strong) is displayed instantly on the web page.
